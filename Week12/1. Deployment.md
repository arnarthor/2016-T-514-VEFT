# Deployment #
[More detailed and further reading](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/core/deploying/)

It is possible to create two types of deployments for .NET Core
## Framework-dependent deployments (FDD)
FDD will only contain your app plus any dependencies that are included in your project.
This means that the version of .NET Core thats currently on the server will be used.
It is possible to specify a version of the framework that should be used for your project, but only if it is available on the server
Pros:
* The OS on the server you are deploying doesn't matter.
* Size of the deployment will be smaller than SCD

Cons:
* If you are running a specific version of .NET Core on your local machine, it is possible to run into version specific bugs on the remote server.
* If the framework running on the machine is updated it could break your application.

### Deploying without third-party dependencies
If your application doesn't use any 3rd party libraries, it is only a matter of building and testing the app on your machine and then publishing it using the dotnet utility:

**build** & **restore** the app
dotnet restore 
dotnet build 

dotnet **test** using dotnet-test or run any other tool

dotnet **publish** -f \<yourappname\>\<versionnumber\> -c release
(e.g. dotnet publish -f punchy1.0 -c releases) would create a directory named publish inside your project (./bin/release/punchy/publish)

Now you can copy this file to the server.

### Deploying with third-party dependencies
This is almost the same process as the one before, except a reference to the dependencies is needed.
You need to add them to the dependencies sections in project.json
```javascript
"dependencies": {
   "Microsoft.NETCore.App": {
     "type": "platform",
     "version": "1.0.0"
   },
   "example dependency": "6.6.6"
 },
```
then simply: 

**build** & **restore** the app
dotnet restore 
dotnet build 

dotnet **test** using dotnet-test or run any other tool

dotnet **publish** -f \<yourappname\>\<versionnumber\> -c release
(e.g. dotnet publish -f punchy1.0 -c releases) would create a directory named publish inside your project (./bin/release/punchy/publish)

Now you can copy this file to the server.

## Self-contained deployments (SCD)
