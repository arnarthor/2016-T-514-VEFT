# .NET Core xUnit

xunit is a testing framework we can use when unit testing in .NET Core. The concept is the same as in ASP.NET but
in xUnit we use different attributes and methods.

## Connect xunit to the project

It's assumed that you have a project ready and a class library named Services witch contains the Service to test.
Navigate to root folder "Courses" (current path is next to Services class lib) and write in terminal

    % mkdir Tests
    cd Tests
    dotnet new -t xunittest

Now we have created a new Test project. next add the Service project as a debendency in project.json file in Tests folder

Tests/project.json
```
{
    ...
    "dependencies": {
        ...
        "Services": {
            "target": "project"
        }
    },
    ...
}
```

To run tests write in terminal:
    % dotnet restore && dotnet test

Expected output is Something like this:
```
xUnit.net .NET CLI test runner (64-bit osx.10.12-x64)
  Discovering: Tests
  Discovered:  Tests
  Starting:    Tests
  Finished:    Tests
=== TEST EXECUTION SUMMARY ===
   Tests  Total: 1, Errors: 0, Failed: 0, Skipped: 0, Time: 0.215s
SUMMARY: Total: 1 targets, Passed: 1, Failed: 0.
```

## Unit test setup

Lets modify the Tests/Tests.cs to be able to do some tests

```c#
using System;
using Xunit;
using Courses.Services;

namespace Courses.Tests
{
    public class CoursesServiceTest
    {
        private CoursesService _service;
        ...
        public CoursesServiceTest()
        {
            // Notice that there is no TestInitialize attribute. The constructor will be called before each test

            _service = new CoursesService(/* here we should inject mockup database */);

            // TODO: code which will be executed before each test!
        }

        [Fact]
        public void GetCourseByIdTest()
        {
            // Notice the [Fact] attribute - it's the same as [TestMethod]
            // Arrange:
                // make some arrangements
            // Act:
                // call the service function
            // Assert:
                // assert that the outcome of the service function call is as expected
        }
    }
}
```
There are a number of points to consider here:

* The test class can have any name whatsoever. It does need any attribute.
* It may contain as many test methods as we wish. They can be called anything we want. They should also return void, and shouldn't accept any parameters. Most importantly, they should be decorated with the [Fact] attribute or the [[Theory]](https://xunit.github.io/docs/getting-started-desktop.html#write-first-theory).
* If there is a constructor, it will get called __before each test in the class is executed__.
* Each test method should have three sections: Arrange, Act and Assert (see below).

## Exceptions in xunit tests

There is no need to have an exception attribute on the method like in asp.net ```[ExpectedException(typeof(IllegalArgumentException))]```

Example:

```c#
[Fact]
public void AddCourse_MissingName()
{
    // Arrange:
    var model = new CourseViewModel
    {
        Semester  = "20163",
        Credits = 6
    };


    // Act & Assert:
    Assert.Throws<Exception>( () => _service.AddCourse(model));
    // Exception can be any Exception i.e(ArgumentException or some custom exception)
}
```

## Summary

This is just to get you started working with xunit. There is a lot of crucial things in the [Unit Testing chapter](1. Unit testing.md)
that you should read carefully before starting with writing unit tests.
